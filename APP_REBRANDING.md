## Files Still Using Old Name

These files reference "TV Screensaver" in the technical package name only:

- Package: `com.example.tvscreensaver`
- Namespace: `com.example.tvscreensaver`

**This is fine!** The package name doesn't need to match the display name.

## Next Steps

1. **Build the app** - The name "Glance" will appear everywhere
2. **Test on TV** - Verify the new name looks good
3. **(Optional)** Change package name via Android Studio refactoring
